# Mac Theme

I can not take credit for these theme files, anything that happens is up to you. I do not take any responsibility for what happens to your computer. 

The purpose is for there to be a repo that I can come find to have a copy of the mac icons and theme for when ever I need it.

## Gnome install guide.
You must have gnome-tweaks or gnome-tweak-tool

1. extract icons to `~/.icons/`
example:
`~/.icons/Os-Catalina-icons`
or 
`/usr/share/icons/` for all users

2. extract your theme(s) to `~/.themes/
example: 
`~/.themes/Os-Catalina-Gtk-night`
or
`/usr/share/themes/` for all users

3. Open gnome-tweaks and choose your selected theme and icons
